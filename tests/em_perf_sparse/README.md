Test scripts for generating the performance plots in workshop paper. 

- Move the three .fasta files from em_perf/ (not in this directory) into data/ directory before running.
- run em_suite_sparse.sh.
- run redraw_plots.sh to re-draw auto-generated plots into a prettier format for the paper.

Original truth is located in true_abundances.csv, but the error-induced ground truth is in true_abundances_biased.csv.
Ignore true_abundances_2.csv.
