# What this  is
These scripts generate the replicate genomes and synthetic read sets.

# To use
1. prepare_all_replicates.sh -- this simulates the synthetic genomes for each replicate.
2. simulate_reads.sh -- this runs ART to simulate reads.


# Helper scripts (not needed to run directly):
- prepare_genomes.sh
- append_chronostrain_json.sh/.py
- mutate_genome.py
