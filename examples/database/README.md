# What is this directory?

This directory helper scripts for the database generation pipeline.
There are multiple ways to arrive at a "valid" database; these scripts were the ones used in our paper.
None of these scripts are "core" to the package; thus we have provided Jupyter notebook recipes as an example (and as an end-to-end pipeline).
In general, the pipeline ought to be modified/customized based on your needs.


## Try it out!

If you'd rather learn just by trying it out, check out the Jupyter Notebooks located in the `complete_recipes` subdirectory.
